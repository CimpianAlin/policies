# Terms

__Last updated 11/16/14__


### The gist:
 

We (the humans at Minds) create open source software and run the Minds.com social network. We would love for you to use it. Our basic service is free, and we offer paid upgrades for advanced features such as domain hosting, advanced administration and other commercial services. Minds software and services are designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes on your site as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed below appear on your site or get linked to from your site (things like spam, viruses, or illegal content).

If you find a Minds.com channel or site that you believe violates our terms of service, please contact us.

(Note, we’ve decided to make the below Terms of Service available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license,
